                    It was a thrilling journey, starting with some initial delays, but the moment we kicked off, the hackathon was packed with learning, problem-solving, and fun... 
                    Throughout this event, our team collaborated, faced challenges, and pushed our limits to create a project that was well-received. As we worked together, we shared ideas, knowledge, and laughter. It was a journey of growth and camaraderie.

                    SSC_DEV_HACK secured 5th place at the VR Siddhartha Hackathon, marking an unforgettable achievement for our team. We developed an innovative Text-to-Figma Al project that streamlined the design process by automatically converting textual descriptions into Figma designs. The experience was not only a great learning opportunity but also filled with happiness and memorable moments as we worked together to bring our idea to life. </p>

            <h1>Hackathon at VR Siddhartha - January 23rd &amp; 24th, 2025</h1>
           
            <p><strong>Our Hackathon Journey: From Delays to Victory and Fun</strong></p>
            <div>
                
            </div><p>
                The 23rd was a Friday filled with excitement, unexpected delays, and unforgettable moments. I started my journey from MTM at 6 AM, but due to train delays, I reached Gudivada only by 8 AM. Meanwhile, my friend Maheswaram Subrahmanyam woke up at 7:40 AM and called to check on my location. I informed him about the delay, and we estimated reaching our destination by 10 AM. <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Determined to be on time, Maheswaram rushed to the bus stand, only to realize that Chandu and I were still on our way. As he waited, he also had to coordinate with his friend's father for the lane he had arranged. When he called us again, we asked him to come directly to the college, promising to wait there. Since he was unfamiliar with the route, we sent him the location, suggesting he take an Uber. While installing the app, his uncle arrived, and he asked for directions. His uncle mentioned Maghalrajupuram VR, which seemed correct. However, after reconfirming the route with a driver, he boarded a bus. <br><br>
                On the way, he called us again for directions. A kind sister sitting next to him advised him to cross the road and take bus number 202 to reach the destination. As the bus stopped, he realized he hadn't bought a ticket, and at that moment, an auto came by. He quickly asked the driver for directions to Siddhartha Engineering College; and after negotiating the fare, I spoke to the driver. Finally, for Rs. 180, Maheswaram safely reached the college and met me, Chandu, and Sairam. <br><br>
                We entered the college, chatting about our chaotic journey; and reached by 10:38 AM. After collecting our IDs, we were directed to the Dukk Block; where our coordinators guided us to our designated seats. Our team, Team-10, was seated in the second row, first seat. At 11 AM, the hackathon problem statement was revealed; and our team got to work. <br><br>
                During this time, we met Vineetha from MBU, who struck up a conversation about our college and names. Soon; our teams started mingling, and what could have been a regular hackathon turned into a fun-filled experience. We had casual chit-chat, laughed, and bonded over the challenge; making the event far more enjoyable than expected. The MBU team transformed what could have been a tedious hackathon into an exciting one. <br><br>
                The next day, things got even crazier. We had friendly fights and endless teasing, especially targeting Nandini. While the review was ongoing, the MBU team had to leave; but we continued chaffing and ignored calls from our coordinators. However, when we finally went for the final review; something unexpected happened—we made it to the Top 5! <br><br>
                I was drenched in sweat from excitement, and we gave our PPT presentation with enthusiasm. Just as we wrapped up; the MBU team called, saying they had booked two tickets and insisted that we join them for a movie. Chandu and I decided to go, and we had a fantastic time watching the film and enjoying the evening. Afterward, Nandu and Chandu went to Nandu's home; while Sairam and I headed to ours. By 12:20 AM, we finally wrapped up an exhilarating day filled with fun, teamwork, and memories that would last a lifetime. <br><br>
                This hackathon was more than just a competition—it was about friendships; experiences, and the unexpected joy that comes with stepping out of our comfort zones. Thanks to the MBU team for making it a remarkable journey!<br><br>
